# Learning-R---Descriptive-Statistics
Using R for a homework on giving basic descriptive analysis 

I am learning how to use R for descriptive statistics for a homework from my master's program. For concerns over privacy, I cannot share the dataset. 


The Problem Definition:  

Over the past decades Europe has experienced a growing demand for graduates and ph.d.'s,
to support the development of the knowledge based economy's key technologies. In response,
one has witnessed an increasing inflow of Ph.D.-students generally. This also happened in
Flanders and at Ghent University.

While in many countries, Ph.D. students must pay a substantial registration fee for the
training they receive, here they are for the large part not only paid living expenses but an
actual full salary. For governments and policy makers who thus support the ph.d. students
financially, this begs the question as to how well the current system works, is it (cost)eective?
Against this background, SOOI, an Interuniversity consortium grant was awarded by the
Flemish government. In the context of SOOI, Ghent university focused on studying the
trajectory of Ph.D.s, doctoral careers and the mobility of researchers.
